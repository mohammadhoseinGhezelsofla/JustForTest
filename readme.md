#just for test
Hi.
We are here to just test some of markdown language things.
Also, we are here to exercise some of git commands.
Lets commit this text until now.

##Second commit:
Hi again.
It is second commit and I'm going to add a list with markdown language too.
OK, lets see:
- it should be first option.
- and this should be second option.
- maybe third option?
- and maybe fourst option, who knows

OK, Lets commit it and send this repo to github.
