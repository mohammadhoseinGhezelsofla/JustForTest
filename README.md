# just for test:
Hi.
We are here to just test some of markdown language things.
Also, we are here to exercise some of git commands.
Lets commit this text until now.

## Second commit:
Hi again.
It is second commit and I'm going to add a list with markdown language too.
OK, lets see:
- it should be first option.
- and this should be second option.
- maybe third option?
- and maybe fourst option, who knows

OK, Lets commit it and send this repo to github.
## O, Bad!
What happened?
I made a repo in my github.
not choosed to add read me file, not choosed any git ignore file and not choosed any license, because I didn't want all of them! I had a readme file (what here you are reading), I told myself it should be show when my repo open! but, no, this file is not opened!
I asked [chat gpt](https://chatgpt.com).
1. Rename your file to `README.md`.
2. Add a space (" ") after your # sign!

OK, lets do these things and see what will happened!
